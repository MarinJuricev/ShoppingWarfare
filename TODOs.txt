TODOs:

Use a single snackbar state ?
Migrate to Kotest and Junit5
Moduralize,
Remove Android specific dependencies,
Write out a BE for the app and remove Firebase ( we could use the Firebase internally for auth or w/e )
KMM
 - Try out the SKIE Touchlab plugin
 - Decompose / Voyager for shared navigation logic ?
 - A bespoke viewModel layer with custom CFlow or something like NativeCoroutines ( depends on the impression of the SKIE plugin )
