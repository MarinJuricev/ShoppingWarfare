TODOs:

Use a single snackbar state ?
Play around with the Store5 Library
Migrate to KSP version that uses K2
Try out Context Receivers/Parameters
Moduralize,
Baseline Profiles
Remove Android specific dependencies,
Add dependabot or renovate to track version updates
Write out a BE for the app and remove Firebase ( we could use the Firebase internally for auth or w/e )
KMM
 - Try out the SKIE Touchlab plugin
 - Decompose / Voyager / Appyx for shared navigation logic ?
 - A bespoke viewModel layer with custom CFlow or something like NativeCoroutines ( depends on the impression of the SKIE plugin )
